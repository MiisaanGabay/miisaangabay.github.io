# What is this?

For the curious English speakers, this is website that allows you to measure the poetic metre of a popular type of Somali poem known as 'Gabay'. Gabay lines are broken into 2 parts, with the first part consisting of 12 vowels (not syllables, for aa is counted as two, despite being one syllable) on the pattern of 4 3 2 3. It is worth noting that long vowels cannot be separated, so if the 4th vowel is the beginning of a vowel pair in the first part, then you have broken the poetic metre. The second part has 3 consecutive single-vowel syllables, 2 double-vowel syllables, and one short lone syllable - not necessarily in that order. There is also a requirement to have a letter, in which every part of every line has at least one word beginning with that letter.
